# Developer Specification: Modern Wolfenstein 3D-Style Game in Three.js

## 1. Project Overview

**Concept:**  
A retro-inspired first-person shooter built using three.js. The game captures the core gameplay mechanics and aesthetic of Wolfenstein 3D while incorporating modern graphics, dynamic lighting, smooth animations, and 3D spatial audio. It is designed for modern desktop browsers and features session-based play with handcrafted levels.

**Core Features:**
- First-person movement and shooting mechanics.
- Handcrafted maze-like levels with a modern visual polish.
- Predictable enemy behavior.
- Interactive elements (keys, switches, doors, secret passages).
- Level-based progression with a narrative conveyed via environment design (no cutscenes/dialogue).
- Classic HUD and scoring system.
- Three weapon types: pistol, machine gun, shotgun.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Gameplay Mechanics
- **Movement & Controls:**
    - FPS navigation using classic keyboard (WASD) and mouse for aiming.
    - No support for gamepads or touch input.

- **Combat & Weapons:**
    - Weapons: Pistol, Machine Gun, Shotgun.
    - Shooting mechanics should be straightforward with predictable enemy patterns.
    - Particle effects (muzzle flashes, bullet impacts, enemy death animations) are strictly visual enhancements.

- **Interactive Objects:**
    - Keys, switches, doors, and secret passages integrated into level designs.

- **Progression & Scoring:**
    - Session-based game structure (each session is a single run through levels).
    - Levels designed to track scoring based on enemy kills and level completion speed.
    - Narrative conveyed through level design (no cutscenes or dialogue).

### 2.2 Visual & Audio Enhancements
- **Graphics:**
    - Use three.js for 3D rendering.
    - Modern enhancements including:
        - Dynamic lighting.
        - High-resolution textures.
        - Smooth animations.
- **Audio:**
    - Modern 3D spatial sound for effects (gunfire, footsteps, ambient sounds).
    - No background music.

### 2.3 User Interface & Menus
- **HUD:**
    - Display health, ammo count, and keys collected in a retro-style layout.
- **Main Menu & Settings:**
    - Main Menu includes:
        - Start New Game
        - Instructions/Help
        - Settings (limited to volume and control configurations)
        - Pause menu during gameplay.
- **No advanced customization options:**
    - No graphics quality settings or key binding customizations beyond the basic control scheme.

### 2.4 Level Design
- **Design Approach:**
    - All levels are handcrafted and hardcoded into the game (no in-game editor or external tool required).
    - Maze-like, similar to the original Wolfenstein 3D layout, but with modern graphical elements.
- **Asset Management:**
    - Use asynchronous asset loading to ensure minimal load times.
    - Implement level streaming where feasible to optimize performance.

## 3. Architecture & Implementation

### 3.1 Framework & Libraries
- **Primary Rendering Library:** three.js
- **Core Languages:**
    - JavaScript/TypeScript for client-side logic.
    - HTML/CSS for UI and menus.
- **Audio Library:** Use Web Audio API integrated with three.js for 3D spatial sound effects.

### 3.2 Project Structure
- **Entry Point:**
    - An `index.html` that loads the main JavaScript file.
- **Directory Layout (suggested):**
  ```
  /src
    /assets         # Textures, audio files, models
    /levels         # Handcrafted level definitions (could be JSON or hardcoded JS objects)
    /lib            # Three.js and any other external libraries
    /scripts        # Main game scripts (game loop, rendering, physics, UI)
  /tests            # Unit and integration tests
  index.html
  ```

### 3.3 Data Handling
- **Level Data:**
    - Hardcoded within source files or loaded from static JSON files.
    - Each level includes details about geometry, interactive object positions (keys, switches, doors), enemy placements, and scoring metrics.
- **Asset Loading:**
    - Use asynchronous JavaScript promises (or async/await) to load textures, audio, and models.
    - Preload assets before level start; display a simple loading screen if necessary.

### 3.4 Error Handling & Debugging Strategies
- **Asset Loading Errors:**
    - Implement error callbacks or promise rejections with fallback logic (e.g., retry mechanism or placeholder asset display).
    - Log errors to the console with descriptive messages.
- **Runtime Errors:**
    - Wrap critical functions in try/catch blocks.
    - Use a global error handler to catch unexpected exceptions and, if possible, recover gracefully (e.g., pause the game and display an error message).
- **Debug Tools:**
    - Include a developer mode toggle that can display additional debug information (such as frame rate, asset loading status, collision boundaries, etc.) for testing purposes.

## 4. Testing Plan

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- **Core Functions:**
    - Test game loop, collision detection, enemy AI (even if predictable), and weapon firing logic.
- **Asset Loading:**
    - Unit tests for asynchronous asset loaders to ensure correct handling of successes and failures.
- **Data Validation:**
    - Validate level data structures (JSON schema if applicable) to ensure no malformed data.

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- **Gameplay Scenarios:**
    - Simulate complete game sessions to ensure levels load correctly, HUD updates, and gameplay mechanics (movement, shooting, enemy interactions) behave as expected.
- **UI Testing:**
    - Test transitions between the main menu, settings, and gameplay screens.
    - Ensure that pausing and resuming gameplay work without issues.

### 4.3 Performance Testing
- **Browser Compatibility:**
    - Verify smooth performance on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- **Asset Load Time:**
    - Monitor asynchronous loading times and optimize if any asset causes noticeable delays.
- **Frame Rate:**
    - Ensure the game maintains an acceptable frame rate (targeting 60 FPS on supported hardware).

### 4.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Feedback Collection:**
    - Have a small group of testers (with varying levels of experience with retro shooters) play the game.
    - Collect feedback on gameplay feel, control responsiveness, and visual/audio quality.
- **Iterative Fixes:**
    - Adjust parameters based on tester feedback before final release.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

- **Hosting:**
    - The game will be hosted as a web application accessible via modern desktop browsers.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - Set up a CI pipeline to run automated tests on code commits.
- **Versioning:**
    - Use semantic versioning to manage releases.
